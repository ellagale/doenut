Once uploaded, the easiest way to install will be via `pip`

## From source with poetry
First download a release or just clone the git repo as normal. 
DoENUT uses poetry to handle its dependencies. 
You can install to the current environment using: 

```commandline
pip install poetry
poetry install
```
As is normal with python packages we recommend you install DoENUT into a virtual environment such as conda.
